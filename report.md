# Report for assignment 4 Group 19

This is the report markdown file of assignment 4 by Group 19. The members for this group assignment are: E-Joon Ko, Niklas Tomsic, Caroline Borg, and Jakob Berggren.

## Project

Name: Algorithms (Pythonic Data Structures and Algorithms)

URL: https://github.com/keon/algorithms

Minimal and clean example implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python 3.

## Onboarding experience

For this assignment, our group decided to choose a new project compared to the project chosen in assignment 3. This decision was made because this new project had well defined issues which seemed clear to solve and was done in Python 3 which our group was more comfortable with. Meanwhile our previous project Jsoniter (http://jsoniter.com/java-features.html) had vague issues, making it hard for us to determine how to approach the assignment.

The onboarding experience for Algorithms was a lot smoother than Jsoniter due to couple of reasons. First off, being able to run unittests on this project was as simple as importing the project and simply running unittest in the relevant directory. Compared to Algorithms, Jsonited required us to use a IDE such as Intellij to easily work with Maven and have the correct dependencies for the project, which took a while and didn't work properly until we tweaked some of the Maven dependencies. Therefore, overall the onboarding experience with Algorithms has been easy and straightforward.

Algorithms also has a much better documentation present in it's readme file compared to Jsoniter, as it has detailed instructions on how to test, install, and uninstall the software. It also has a long detailed list of every single function present in the project, making navigation and comprehension easy for the group.
## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;

2. discussions within parts of the group;

3. reading documentation;

4. configuration and setup;

5. analyzing code/output;

6. writing documentation;

7. writing code;

8. running code?

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.
